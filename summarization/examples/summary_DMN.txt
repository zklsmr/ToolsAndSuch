a key goal in neuroscience is to understand how the structure of cognition arises from the topographical organization of the cortex . recent advances in the field of connectomics have revealed multiple large-scale networks, each characterized by distinct functional profiles . the results suggest that the default-mode network consists of regions at the top of a representational hierarchy that describe the current cognitive landscape .
the principal gradient of connectivity in the human brain is anchored at one end by primary and unimodal visual, somatosensory/motor, and auditory regions . at the other end are regions including the angular gyrus, rostral anterior cingulate, posteromedial cortex, middle and superior frontal cortex, and the temporal perisylvian region . despite the high reproducibility of large-scale resting-state networks (1, 44â€“46), there is no clear
the principal gradient corresponds to the intrinsic geometry of the cortex . regions in the DMN have the greatest geodesic distance along the cortical surface from primary sensory/motor areas . large-scale networks are arranged along this axis, with the same transitions between consistently adjacent networks occurring throughout the cortex (Fig. 4). the results are consistent with a recent modification of the rostral-caudal processing gradient described within lateral frontal cortex (59, 60).
